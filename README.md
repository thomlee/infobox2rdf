# infobox2rdf

This program allows users to generate huge RDF datasets from the infobox data in Wikipedia dump files.

Please check out the following papers to understand how this program is used and can be applied in research projects:

* [Extraction of RDF Dataset from Wikipedia Infobox Data](https://www.academia.edu/11650180/Extraction_of_RDF_Dataset_from_Wikipedia_Infobox_Data)
* [Automating Relational Database Schema Design for Very Large Semantic Datasets](https://www.academia.edu/3121712/Automating_Relational_Database_Schema_Design_for_Very_Large_Semantic_Datasets)

Note: This project was initially hosted in Google Code at [code.google.com/p/infobox2rdf](code.google.com/p/infobox2rdf). Since Google Code is closing down, this project is moved to here at [github.com/thomlee/infobox2rdf](https://github.com/thomlee/infobox2rdf).
